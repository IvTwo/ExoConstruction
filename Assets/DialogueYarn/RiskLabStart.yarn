Virtual Instructor: To evaluate tasks, you’ll use a tool called REBA – Rapid Entire Body Assessment. It helps identify which postures and movements are risky.

Virtual Instructor: You’ll answer simple questions about the worker’s body positions—like how much they bend, reach, or lift.

Virtual Instructor: The system will calculate a risk score from 1 (safe) to 15 (very risky). The higher the score, the more urgent it is to fix the posture or bring in support like an exoskeleton.
